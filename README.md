Documentation of my team work during the FeatureCloud Hackathon

FeatureCloud is a platform for federated and privacy-preserving AI in biomedicine, enabling straightforward development and execution of federated AI methods as apps.

The goal of the hackthon was to prediction colorectal cancer (CRC) phenotype, as cancerous, an adenoma(a non cancerous tumor) , or healthy, and sub-phenotypes (e.g. CRC stage) using Shotgun metagenome (a method used to evaluate bacterial diversity and  abundance of microbes) data of gut microbiomes from 1,400 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients acquired from ten distributed hospitals.
